A Robot Distributed Operation System (RDOS) that makes robotics accessible to everyone.

## What is Tafy Studio?

Tafy Studio is a comprehensive framework for building and operating robots. Unlike traditional approaches that treat robots as single computers with peripherals,
Tafy Studio embraces the distributed nature of modern roboticsâ€”where multiple compute nodes work together as a cohesive system.

**Note:** We intentionally use "operation system" rather than "operating system." Tafy Studio orchestrates robot operations across distributed nodes; it is not an OS in the traditional sense.

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Early Development** - We're building the foundation for the 30-minute quick start experience.

### Current Progress

- âœ… Monorepo structure with Turborepo
- âœ… Hub UI (Next.js) - Basic structure
- âœ… Hub API (FastAPI) - Core endpoints
- âœ… Node Agent (Go) - Device discovery
- âœ… CI/CD Pipeline - Multi-arch builds
- ðŸš§ HAL implementation - In progress
- ðŸš§ ESP32 firmware - Coming soon
- ðŸš§ Node-RED integration - Coming soon

## Key Features

- **30-Minute Quick Start**: From installation to moving robot in under 30 minutes
- **Plug-and-Play Hardware**: Automatic discovery and configuration of devices
- **Visual Programming**: Build complex behaviors without writing code
- **Distributed Architecture**: Seamlessly scale from one to many compute nodes
- **Local-First Design**: Full functionality without internet connectivity
