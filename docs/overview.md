# Overview

**Tafy Studio** is a **Distributed Robotics Operation System (DROS)**:
- Local-first cluster with **k3s**
- **Node-RED** low-code flows
- **NATS** messaging & discovery
- ESP-style firmware + containerized drivers
- Optional AI blocks (vision/policy)

Why DROS? Robots are distributed systems—sensors, actuators, and models across multiple computers. Tafy embraces that reality so you don’t write drivers or fight networks.
